## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. Express.js is used for routing and then to store data, I implemented a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. In addition to using the Express.js and Mongoose packages, I have also incorporated Moment to format timestamps.

## Installation

In order to use this application, you'll need to follow these steps:

```
1. Clone the github repository using the command `git clone git@github.com:sely1724/social-media-api.git`
2. Install npm by entering `npm init` into the terminal.
3. Run `npm i` to download all applications in the package.json folder.
4. Seed Mongo DB by opening up the terminal for seed.js and typing in node seed.js
5. Open up terminal on the index.js file and connect to server by typing in `node index.js`
6. Use Insomnia to test routes
```
